   Serious thanks:		a.g., for tons of bugfixes and code-refactorings   
				stupid_chris, for the RealChuteLite implementation
            			Taverius, for correcting a ton of incorrect values  
				Tetryds, for finding lots of bugs and issues and not letting me get away with them, and work on example crafts
            			sarbian, for refactoring code for working with MechJeb, and the Module Manager updates  
            			ialdabaoth (who is awesome), who originally created Module Manager  
                        	Regex, for adding RPM support  
				DaMichel, for some ferramGraph updates and some control surface-related features  
            			Duxwing, for copy editing the readme
